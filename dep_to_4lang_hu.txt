#Mapping of magyarlanc dependency relations to 4lang edges.
#
#The line "rel TAB i,j" means the dependency relation rel(x,y) should convert
#to an arrow of color i pointing from x to y and an arrow of color j pointing
#from y to x. "-" means no arrow, "?" means undecided or ambiguous.
#
#Further TAB separated fields may specify binary relations that should hold
#between x and y, the order can be reversed with "!". E.g. HAS will trigger
#x HAS y, !HAS will trigger Y HAS X
