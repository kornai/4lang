# ThreeFormatBinary_WithEvelin
##discription: This is an irtg group I am developping with many help from Evelin, who understands all of the linguistic background of the work. Her irtg transformes most of the dependency graphs into a four lang graph correctly, but it has to be cleared from old mistakes, debuged and impruved until it is a dynamic, modular and transparent.

##ALTO console usage
## discription: ALTO is tricky to use, but we figured out, so here you are. We give an example for imput file too.
###Use this command:java -cp <path to ALTO's jar> de.up.ling.irtg.script.ParsingEvaluator <path to inputfile> -g <path to one of the irtg's> -I tree
###forExample:java -cp "/home/hollo/BMENotes/6.felev_4,83_37/Ã–nlab(5)/alto-2.2-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar" de.up.ling.irtg.script.ParsingEvaluator input_example_1 -g "NewSolution_(stable).irtg" -I tree

##TFB_Main
###discription: This is the place of the Main Solution. It is developed by every example. It is ready when all of Evelin's irtg-s are processed by us. It have been reseted: 2018.07.25
### TFB_Main.irtg
#### date-of-creation:2018.07.23
#### discription: This is the final solutions file. It contains only the three necessary algebras. A tag tree algebra for the sintactic tree, a graph algebra for the dependency graph and a graph algebra for the four lang graph. It implements all finishe Noun Phrase example.
#### usage: Use this tree for example: NP3(DT(some),JJ(big),NN(apple)) or NP2(NP2(DT(The),NN(Moi)),PP2(IN(in),NP( NNP(Iraq))))
### TFB_Main_Test.irtg
#### date-of-creation:2018.07.05

##TFB_Basic
