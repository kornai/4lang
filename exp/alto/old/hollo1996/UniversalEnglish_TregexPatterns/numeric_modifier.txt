	"/^(?:WH)?(?:NP|NX|NML)(?:-TMP|-ADV)?$/ < (CD|QP=target !$- CC)"
	// $ is so phrases such as "$ 100 million buyout" get amod(buyout, $)
	"/^(?:WH)?(?:NP|NX|NML)(?:-TMP|-ADV)?$/ < (ADJP=target <: (QP !< /^[$]$/))"
	// Phrases such as $ 100 million get converted from (QP ($ $) (CD 100) (CD million)) to
	// (QP ($ $) (QP (CD 100) (CD million))). This next tregex covers those phrases.
	// Note that the earlier tregexes are usually enough to cover those phrases, such as when
	// the QP is by itself in an ADJP or NP, but sometimes it can have other siblings such
	// as in the phrase "$ 100 million or more". In that case, this next expression is needed.
	"QP < QP=target < /^[$]$/"
