* An auxiliary of a clause is a non-main verb of the clause
* e.g., a modal auxiliary, or a form of be, do or have in a
* periphrastic tense.
*
* Contrary to the older SD and arguments of Pullum (1982) and
* following, infinitive to is not analyzed as an auxiliary.
* Instead, it is analyzed as a mark.
*
* Example: <br/>
* "Reagan has died" &rarr; {@code aux}(died, has)
