* The "multi-word expression" grammatical relation.
* This covers various multi-word constructions for which it would
* seem pointless or arbitrary to claim grammatical relations between words:
* as well as, rather than, instead of, but also;
* such as, because of, all but, in addition to ....
* <p/>
* Examples: <br/>
* "dogs as well as cats" &rarr;
* {@code mwe}(as, well)<br/>
* {@code mwe}(as, as)<p/>
* "fewer than 700 bottles" &rarr;
* {@code mwe}(fewer, than)
