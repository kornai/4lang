* The "name" relation. This relation is used for proper
* nouns constituted of multiple nominal elements. Words joined by name should all be part of a
* minimal noun phrase; otherwise regular syntactic relations should be used.
* In general, names are annotated in a flat, head-initial structure, in which all words in the name
* modify the first one using the {@code name} label.
* <p/>
*
* The distinction between {@code compound} and {@code name} can only be made on the basis of NER tags.
* For this reason, we use the {@code compound} relation for all flat NPs and replace it with the {@code name}
* relation during post-processing.
* <p/>
* See also {@link UniversalEnglishGrammaticalStructure#processNames}.
* <p/>
* Example: <br/>
* "Hillary Rodham Clinton" &rarr;
* {@code name}(Hillary, Rodham)
* {@code name}(Hillary, Clinton)<p/>
