	// The next relation handles a colon between sentences
	// and similar punct such as --
	// Sometimes these are lists, especially in the case of ";"
	// so we don't trigger if there is a CC|CONJP that occurs
	// anywhere other than the first child
	// First child can occur in rare circumstances such as
	// "But even if he agrees -- which he won't -- etc etc"
	"S|FRAG|VP < (/^:$/ $+ /^S/=target) !<, (__ $++ CC|CONJP)"
	// two juxtaposed sentences; common in web materials (but this also matches quite a few wsj things)
	"@S|FRAG < (@S|SBARQ|SQ|FRAG $++ @S|SBARQ|SQ|FRAG=target !$++ @CC|CONJP|MWE !$++ (/:/ < /;/))"
	"@S|FRAG|VP < (/^:$/ $-- /^V/ $+ @NP=target) !< @CONJP|CC", // sometimes CC cases are right node raising, etc.
