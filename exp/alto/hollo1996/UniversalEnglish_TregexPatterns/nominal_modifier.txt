* The "nominal modifier" grammatical relation. The nmod relation is
* used for nominal modifiers of nouns or clausal predicates. {@code nmod}
* is a noun functioning as a non-core (oblique) argument or adjunct.
* In English, nmod is used for prepositional complements.
* <p/>
* (The preposition in turn may be modifying a noun, verb, etc.)
* We here define cases of VBG quasi-prepositions like "including"
* "concerning", etc. as instances of pobj (unlike the Penn Treebank).
* <p/>
* Example: <br/>
* "I sat on the chair" &rarr;
* {@code nmod}(sat, chair)
* <p/>
* (The preposition can be called a FW for pace, versus, etc. It can also
* be called a CC - but we don't currently handle that and would need to
* distinguish from conjoined PPs. Jan 2010 update: We now insist that the
* NP must follow the preposition. This prevents a preceding NP measure
* phrase being matched as a nmod. We do allow a preposition tagged RB
* followed by an NP pobj, as happens in the Penn Treebank for adverbial uses
* of PP like "up 19%")
