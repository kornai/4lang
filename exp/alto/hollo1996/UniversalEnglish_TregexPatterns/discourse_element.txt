* The "discourse element" grammatical relation. This is used for interjections and
* other discourse particles and elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure
* of the sentence, except in an expressive way). We generally follow the
* guidelines of what the Penn Treebanks count as an INTJ. They
* define this to include: interjections (oh, uh-huh, Welcome), fillers (um, ah)
* and discourse markers (well, like, actually, but not: you know).
* We also use it for emoticons.
