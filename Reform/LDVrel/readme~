The goal of this working directory is to systematize the relation of 4lang with the LDV.
There is a significant skew between Procter:1978 (from where the ldv list originates)
and the much looser Bullon:2003 (which is linked as ldoce4.tsv here). Our goal is to steer
close to the original, non-dumbed-down version.

Of the 2197 words in ldv (prefixes and suffixes are excluded, these are dealt with in the
Morph directory) only 2081 appear on the right hand side of ldoce4, and 58 of these only once,
see ldv.weight. The file usedindef lists all words used on the rhs of ldoce4. There are 14464
of these, which clearly shows the dilution of lexicographic principles from Procter to Bullon.

We are working with four layers of 4lang, which are, in terms of decreasing size: 

4lang -- 3504 lines, but not nearly machine parseable.

1384 -- 1637 lines, fully parseable, but probably still several entries that are pre-Reform

600 -- 750 lines, fully parsable

400 -- 718 lines, the uroboros core of 600
