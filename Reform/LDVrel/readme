The goal of this working directory is to systematize the relation of 4lang with the LDV.
There is a significant skew between Procter:1978 (from where the ldv list originates)
and the much looser Bullon:2003 (which is linked as ldoce4.tsv here). Our goal is to steer
close to the original, non-dumbed-down version.

Of the 2197 words in ldv (prefixes and suffixes are excluded, these are dealt with in the
Morph directory) only 2081 appear on the right hand side of ldoce4, and 58 of these only once,
see ldv.weight. The file usedindef lists all words used on the rhs of ldoce4. There are 14464
of these, which clearly shows the dilution of lexicographic principles from Procter to Bullon.

There are two versions of the ldv. The one called ldv is taken from
https://www.pu-kumamoto.ac.jp/~rlavin/resources/wordlists/LDV.html, this is
the original.  British spellings have been Americanized (not quite
consistently), whitespace in multi-word expressions is replaced by _, and
everything is downcased.  The other version, amldv, is based on the
vocab_definitions.pdf file from Longman which was dumped by gs
-sDEVICE=txtwrite -o output.txt vocab_definitions.pdf and edited a lot, see
Attic.

There are 1910 words common to the am and gb versions, but there are plenty of
differences: 187 amonly, 280 gbonly.















We are working with four layers of 4lang, which are, in terms of decreasing size: 

4lang -- 3504 lines, but not nearly machine parseable.

1384 -- 1637 lines, fully parseable, but probably still several entries that are pre-Reform
     the uroboros core of this is now 777 words
     
600 -- 750 lines, fully parsable

400 -- 718 lines, the uroboros core of 600, should be called 600.uro
