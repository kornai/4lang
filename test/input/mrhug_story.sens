A 61-year old furniture salesman was pushed down the shaft of a freight elevator yesterday in his downtown Brooklyn store by two robbers while a third attempted to crush him with the elevator car because they were dissatisfied with the $1,200 they had forced him to give them . 
The buffer springs at the bottom of the shaft prevented the car from crushing the salesman , John J. Hug , after he was pushed from the first floor to the basement . 
The car stopped about 12 inches above him as he flattened himself at the bottom of the pit . 
Mr. Hug was pinned in the shaft for about half an hour until his cries attracted the attention of a porter . 
The store at 340 Livingston Street is part of the Seaman's Quality Furniture chain . 
Mr. Hug was removed by members of the Police Emergency Squad and taken to Long Island College Hospital . 
He was badly shaken , but after being treated for scrapes of his left arm and for a spinal injury was released and went home . 
He lives at 62-01 69th Lane , Maspeth , Queens . 
He has worked for seven years at the store , on the corner of Nevins Street , and this was the fourth time he had been held up in the store . 
The last time was about one year ago , when his right arm was slashed by a knife-wielding robber .
