The goal of nautilus is to tighten the uroboros vocabulary. We start
from the 400 file and add in material as long as we need to, creating
the outward spiral 401 402 \ldots 406. This wan is closed definitionally,
and has 747 elements. As such, it is taking the place of the previous ../Reform/600

We worked with four files of decreasing size: ../4lang, ../Reform/1383,
../Reform/600, and 400 (the first three have local copies here). The smaller a
file the better maintained it is, so the idea is that the end-result of 400
extension will take the role of 600, and bugfixes are carried outward.

Since this is done, we ran

python3 ../Reform/remove_defined.py -i 406 >../Reform/400

400 is a tighter uroboros set, with 423 elements. remove_defind can no longer reduce it,
but maybe uroboros.py can







base.$i is created by

cut -f1,8 $i >base.$i

and miss.$i by

python3 ../Reform/get_undefined.py -i $i > miss.$i




To run uroboros.py, use bash and start with uro/bin/activate

ssh -L 8899:localhost:8899 kornai@nessie.ilab.sztaki.hu -N
